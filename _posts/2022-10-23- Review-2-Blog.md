**Summary of Project**

The project I am reviewing is “Learn from the Past, Organize for the Future, Make Democracy Work” which discusses a group named Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee also known as SNCC. SNCC was an organization that allowed students and young people to participate in the Civil Rights Movement. Prior to this organization, few young people had their own groups to advocate for them during the Civil Rights Movement. Due to young students conducting a sit-in in North Carolina to fight against segregation, attention was noticed across the entire nation. This documentary website explores monumental events, people, and documents that demonstrate students and young activists contributed to creating SNCC. 

**Assessment of Humanistic claims**

Regarding the humanities approach, history and human geography are aspects that are demonstrated within this project. It relates to history because this organization was created in the 1960’s after North Carolina began sit-ins that protested against segregation. Although the viewer gets to learn more about the history of this period, I noticed the human geography aspect of this project. On the map view, there are different points that give viewers an understanding of what people were doing and what eventsa transpired throughout different parts of the United States. Both humanities were demonstrated throughout the project, however, perhaps adding a section stating how it correlates could help the viewer too.  

**Website Layout**

While looking at the websites’ home page, you start off by seeing an introduction of what SNCC is with a slideshow of pictures on the top. You can also see the tabs across the page to get a better understanding of what particular information you want to look at. Within each tab you click on, you can see subsections that the viewer can look through. It can become very overwhelming at times since there is a lot of information, but once you get comfortable with the website, it becomes fairly easy to navigate. 

At the bottom of the home page, you see three big boxes that contain generalized topics and the viewer can click on them if interested. The boxes include Organizing Tradition, Voting Rights, and Black Power. These topics are also located under the resources tab within the “Themes section”. To get a closer and deeper look at the website, there is an “About” tab at the bottom of the home page. The “About” section is all the way at the bottom which I feel viewers would overlook. Perhaps having it at the top of the page or in its own tab would be helpful.

**Assessment of technology**

Throughout the website, there are numerous types of technological uses to portray data and information that allows the viewer to become interactive. Two of the main blueprints the creator used were an interactive map and a timeline. It was really easy to navigate and I learned a lot of information just by going through the timeline and map features. 

**Usability of technology**

As I was reviewing the entirety of the website, I found using the different features fairly easy to use. Under each section, there is a lot of information that is covered whether it shows videos, original documents/posters, or audio recordings. While looking through the different pictures, documents, and posters, the majority of the information is accessible for the viewer. On all of the accessible data, you can click on the original document and it will take you to a new tab to see it in full screen.

On the other hand, some of the information won’t load or show up on a new page. For example, on the top tab it states “Inside Sncc” then I clicked “Story of SNCC” and followed by clicking on “Birth of Sncc”. I was looking through the original documents/pictures on the side of the screen and I clicked on the student report of the sit-ins that challenged segregation. It popped up with an “error not found” when it opened to another tab. I could see the preview of the report on the website but not the full text. I also found another example that said on the document preview “Not Found” but once you click the external link, it shows the original picture. I encountered this a few more times within the website, but the majority of the documents were accessible.

While going through the other parts of the site, you can see the full text of the original writings and documents. While that is a good aspect for the viewer to see, some of the documents you cannot read. You can not read some of the documents due to the illegible writing or font size of the text. I think the website could benefit by having a transcript on the side of what the document is stating. It would be helpful for the viewer to read exactly what each document is stating and learn from the original text. 

Using the map feature was really interesting to see the different parts of the South and some various parts of the North that was affiliated with the SNCC organization. You can click on different mapping points and it will bring you to a different page. For example, I can click on the Jackson, Mississippi geographical tag which opens the new page with information about people and events that have occurred in that area. You can further click on the specific events and people to learn more about them. On the sides of the page, you can see some original pictures and press reports which give the viewer a personal feel of each city. 
I can also zoom in and out of the map while also having a street view feature. While the street view is a cool feature, I wish it could take me to the exact place of what it looked like during that time. I know it may be hard to implement but I think the viewer can get a lot out of seeing the street view of what the events looked like.

The timeline feature was fairly easy to navigate and it helped me as a new viewer to learn more about SNCC and what it stood for. The timeline goes in depth about voting registration rights, their projects, and election outcomes. When you click on a certain event, it explains what it was, shows original pictures, and also links sources at the bottom of the page. Some of the texts are especially long so it took me a while to read them thoroughly. Possibly having some more breaks between pictures would help the viewer stay engaged within the text. The timeline goes vertically down the page and can become overwheleming. Maybe having the timeline horizontally could allow the viewer to read from left and right.

**How it relates to my grant project proposal**

As I was reviewing this project about SNCC, I found similarities on how it relates to my grant project. My grant project is using a virtual museum feature of famous Black social workers throughout history and what their accomplishments were. The project that I am reviewing inspired me to add a more personal feel as the viewer goes through the museum. Throughout the SNCC website, I felt it was personalized and I truly felt impacted by the stories that were being told. I would use some aspects of this project such as using street view but I will also keep in mind other aspects of this project too.  It overall inspired me by the fact on how it made it known to emphasize the importance of young Black activists and how their accomplishments impacted the United States. In my grant project that is how I want the viewers to take away from learning about Black social workers who accomplished so much in this profession. 

**Conclusion**

Overall, this project was incredibly interesting, informative, and engaging. I learned a lot about what this organization did and how they have impacted American history. The usability of the technology really involves the viewer and allows them to learn about the importance of this era. The map and timeline are amazing and useful features that were added to this project.  I am really glad I found this documentary website.

# About Me Blog
My name is Darcy McLane, my pronouns are she/her and I am a senior who is majoring in the field of Social Work.



Social work has not only interested me because of my parents' similar career choices, but also because of how I personally value the importance of helping others. Social Work is a broad major and I can help multiple vulnerable people and communities. I believe social work is important because it gives a voice to people when they feel unheard. I have never experienced any social work classes until I transferred to CNU for my junior year. Prior to CNU, I went to Thomas Nelson Community College and learned some of the beginning courses such as psychology. Experiencing these classes and other courses has helped me broaden my skills and knowledge for my future career

One of the courses that I am unfamiliar with is Digital Humanities. I am starting this Digital Humanities course with no prior knowledge of the topic, I am excited to expand my writing skills with technology. Not only do I need a writing intensive requirement, I want to see how my skills can improve for my future in school and in the workforce. I am typically not a critical thinker or writer so my goal is to express myself more precisely but within the digital world. 

## Social Work Goals
Once I complete my undergraduate degree in Social Work, I want to attend Virginia Commonwealth University to achieve my Masters. I currently intern at Virginia Health Services James River Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, (I know, a mouthful). The [James River Branch](https://vahs.com/jamesriver/) focuses on taking care of the 65 and older population by helping them through the next transition of their lives. So far it has been a great experience to see what social work is really like outside of the classroom. 

As for my future goals as a social worker, I want to eventually create a non-profit organization or at least be a part of one in an urban setting. I am not sure where I want to live, but I am leaning towards New York City or the Washington D.C area. I always wanted and visoned for community resources to be expanded to bigger communities so more people can have access. We will see if and how this works out, but my passion for helping people is one of my core values that I want to express throughout my career and life. 

As of recently, I have a new respect and realization of the need for the 65 and older population in social work. Last semester I did research on elder exploitation and fraud with members of the community such as Adult Protective Services and financial accountants. While I was collecting data, I presented my findings at the CNU Social Justice Conference. It was an eye opening experience since numerous people did not know the significance of this problem within our region. Go check out what information on the [CNU Social Justice Newsletter](https://www.smore.com/0p8f4-cnu-social-work?ref=email) to see more topics that were discussed.

## More about me

Not only do I enjoy expanding my knowledge within social work and social justice, I try my best to make time for volunteering. In the past, I have volunteered with Meals on Wheels, the Foodbank, and was a camp counselor for vacation bible school. Through volunteering, I have encountered injustices within different communities which has also allowed me to learn more about how to advocate more effectively. 

While volunteering is something I do outside of school, I spend a lot of time with my family, especially my parents, my sister Bridget, and my dog Morgan. Spending time with them always creates good memories since we have done North Carolina week trips, game nights, and just spill the drama. Here is a picture of me and one of my favorite non-human family members :)

Even though my undergraduate college career is coming to an end soon, I would not have traded the experience for the world. All of the topics, values, and knowledge that I have learned has not only affected my professional life but also within my personal life.

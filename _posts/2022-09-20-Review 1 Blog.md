## Summary
_Civil War Washington_ explores various perspectives during the Civil War within Washington, D.C. The data feature includes soldiers' names, hospital visits, and an interactive map of what District of Columbia looked like during 1861-1865. Since D.C. was one of the stronger cities during the Civil War, it was transformed with new infrastructures. The new model of the city assisted the numerous professions during the war such as nurses and soldiers. The data also includes what slaves, bureaucrats, and authors did during this period. This project focuses on educating others on the time period while using technology to make it interactive.


## Humanistic claim 
Relating to the humanities, this project relates to history since the Civil War was a major event in United States history. The overall project portrays the changes that occurred within this city. The project emphasizes the reasoning behind the data and how the humanities disciplines are used. Experts worked on this project regarding the humanities such as computer science, history, and literature. This project uses data from original artifacts from that period such as letters, pictures, and documents. The data was fairly easy to understand but maybe adding more in- depth descriptions would help the viewer. It helps advance knowledge since viewers can see firsthand what was occurring from 1861 to 1865.

## Layout

The organization on the main page is easy to navigate due to the subfolders which give readers an understanding of where the material is located. Once you go through the subfolders, you get a description of what is included in that specific section. I found it helpful especially as a beginner digital humanities student. While looking through the different sections, it also gave descriptions of what each tab entails. Specifically, the maps tab gave instructions on how to use the various tools and what the keys were used for. The overall layout of each tab is very well organized and easy to find what certain topics one is looking for.

For example, this is the data tab and it is organized by sections such as people, places, or events. It gives the viewer a better understanding of what they are looking for. I can also use the search bar within the database if I want to find something that I am interested in.

## Technology 
The use of technology was demonstrated in different ways by using an interactive map, databases, and visualizations. It helps demonstrate what was going on in that time period of the Civil War whether it is through documentation, letters, or hospital visits. The databases allow the content to be organized and can help a viewer go through it easily. If it was traditional, it would be very difficult to find all the information while online I can find it in one section. Most of the technology is easy to use and is also straightforward. It gives instructions and reasoning behind what is being shown under each tab.

## Usability of technology
While having a decent layout of the website, it allowed the website to be incredibly useful when I first was navigating it. Someone who has never looked at a project through a digital humanist lens, I found this website easy to navigate. The layout helps viewers get an understanding of what can be found in this project. One of the reasons the technology was extremely usable was the amount of information and instructions that were given throughout the project. 

For example, the project includes a map of what infrastructures were built during the Civil War in the D.C. area. The project used GIS which stands for a geographical information system. This type of map uses historical maps but involves them with modern technology. It gives you instructions on how to use each part of the map and helps figure out the different infrastructures within the area. It can look overwhelming but you can adjust the map to your liking or what you want to take a closer look at. For example, you can check the box for hospitals on the key and only hospital buildings will show up. It is a really good feature to have for a project about history and if you have any specific problems with the map, the project gives you a contact to get a hold of.

While looking for improvements for the site, I began to have a closer look at the database which includes people and places. But when I clicked on the people, it just listed the soldiers' names without any information about them. I have to go to the Texts tab and scroll to the newspapers and medical cases section. Once I click on newspapers, I can see the actual documents from newspapers and soldiers' medical cases. Searching for the journals was hard to find especially since I did not know it was even available until I saw them within the Texts tab. I think adding a link to the actual documents about the soldiers in the database would be beneficial. 

Once I found the Texts tab, I could access the soldiers' journals and writings which all were the original copies. I went through the majority of the writings and a lot of them were either faded or too small of text to read. Although you can open the text in a new tab and see it closer up, I still have to zoom up and read it. I think having a transcription on the side of the articles could help readers fully read the text and see the perspectives during that period. Here is what the documents currently look like within this project.

## Conclusion of the Civil War Washington Project

Overall, the project has good resources, especially for people who are new to Digital Humanities. The visual aids of hospitals, office quarters, and churches allow the viewer to see what Washington D.C. looked like during that specific time in history. The project also has an interpretation tab that explains why researchers included the data. Some of the visual aids can be improved with transcription or a more in-depth explanation of what the picture or the letter consists of. A really good resource on this project was the interactive map since it gives viewers a way to see the infrastructures and where they were built. The Civil War Washington does an amazing job of bringing to life what this time period entailed and making it interactive for the viewer.

# Reflection Blog 

Before taking my first Digital Humanities course, I had no idea what the topic entailed but now I have a better understanding of what the subject is. Digital Humanities to me means portraying traditional disciplines and while implementing technological tools. During this course, I enjoyed many assignments that assisted with me better understanding the content and the importance of this course. One of the assignments that helped me understand Digital Humanities was completing the Review Blog 1 which entailed exploring a project. Dr. Stover gave us a list of projects which I liked since at that point, I did not know how to find a DH project. My project entailed the Civil War and the changes that occurred in the Washington, D.C area. I enjoyed completing this project because it gave me an idea on what a DH project is supposed to look like and I could also practice how to critique it. Dr. Stoverâ€™s feedback was very helpful to give me a better understanding on what I need to do for my next blog assignment.

Another aspect of the class that I found interesting was instead of doing discussion boards, we completed weekly tweets. Completing the tweets every week gave me time to reflect what we read, discussed, and worked on in class. I liked how it was not a traditional form of a discussion board but still allowed us to interact with our other classmates. Sometimes I found it difficult to figure out what to talk about but Dr. Stover was always willing to help and reminded us in class. On top of that, I enjoyed communicating with my classmates about the assignments and readings in which we all had different interpretations of the articles.

As we had many assignments throughout the semester, we spent a lot of time during class doing peer reviews on each other's projects. I would sometimes would become frustrated to participate in these reviews because we had to have most of the assignments completed before we came to class. Even though it would be due two days after the peer review, I understand the reasoning of completing it for feasible feedback. However, getting feedback from my classmates was helpful since it gave me other viewpoints on format, sentence structure, and overall content. It was also fun to read my peers' projects and help give them constructive feedback. Overall, peer review was a great experience since I have not done this routinely in a class before.

One of the assignments that I struggled with was the grant proposal and completing the different parts of the assignment. I did appreciate that the assignment was broken down into sections so it gave all of us time to thoroughly do each part. I personally wish we saw more examples of grant proposals during class or in the Google Drive so I could see what the finished product was supposed to look like. However, Dr. Stover was very helpful during the whole process if any of us had questions or concerns which was deeply appreciated. 

In conclusion, as I am reflecting on this semester for this course, needless to say I have learned so much about what DH is. Not only did I expand my knowledge on the topic, I also improved my writing skills that have helped me with my other courses. I have noticed the improvement in my writing by making sure my content is informative while also keeping it concise. Through this course, getting feedback from Dr. Stover and classmates about conciseness has been beneficial for my writing. This class contributed to me becoming more confident in writing and as well as being a student.
